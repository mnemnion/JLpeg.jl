# Grammar generators

# Plan of attack: this eventually becomes a full bytecode interpreter, but
# the first thing I need is a generator for Sets, so it will take PSet.

# TODO this needs to take keyword options with defaults, examples:
# full=true, PSets will generate the full set in order

# Status: this conflates "generating characters from a Set" with "confirming that the
# multiset code is valid".  The generator code is unwritten except for this one method,
# but the focus will be on generating random examples of the pattern, and for Sets,
# expanding them into a Vector of the Chars and randomly sampling that is much simpler than
# modifying this code to return a random character would be.
#
# It also makes sense for a generator to receive an IOBuffer, rather than returning String bits.
# We'll want to pass an IOBuffer to the generators and let them feed it, and we need some way to
# seed the randomness so that generation can be consistent between calls, when desired.
#
# So the ultimate fate of this code is unclear. It's very unlikely I'll make further changes to the
# Set compiler or bytecode, but if I do, this code will come into play immediately.
#
# Might end up living in the test framework for JLpegUnicode, which is the suite which really puts Sets
# through their paces.
