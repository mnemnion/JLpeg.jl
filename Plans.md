# Planning for jLPEG

  The intention here is to translate [LPEG](https://github.com/sqmedeiros/lpeglabel), specifically the lpeglabel fork, into idiomatic Julia, and expand it with the various bells and whistles which I've introduced, or plan to, into PEGs generally.

## Primary Sources

In addition to LPEG itself (linked above) we have:

- [LPEG Paper](https://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/docs/peg.pdf) paper describing the implementation of LPEG.

## Prior Art

- [parsimonious.jl](https://github.com/gitfoxi/Parsimonious.jl): A port of a Python library of the same name.  This takes strings and outputs ParseTrees, which will be of some use.  No idea about the internals yet.

- [PEG.jl](https://github.com/wdebeaum/PEG.jl): "Define a Parsing Expression Grammar via a macro and abuse of Julia syntax", a promising quote.  Not how I'm intending to implement this but we'll see what happens. Also no idea about internals.

- [PEGParser.jl](https://github.com/abeschneider/PEGParser.jl): uses Packrat, has a useful-looking `@grammar` macro.  Other than "it's packrat", no idea how it works yet.

## Tools

- [Match.jl](https://juliaservices.github.io/Match.jl/stable/): a macro for match/case style statements, which is an approach to the VM proper.

## Implementation

Wherein I note how I'm building the thing.

### Relabeling

At some point I intend to add serializing of bytecode, just a (versioned!!) minimal
string form which allows a zero-logic construction of a Grammar.  That would be a
good time to remov NoOps, which get left around by various optimizations. There's a
reason every instruction set in existence has them, but it's aesthetically
unsatisfying to leave them in.

It isn't the only or even the best reason to want to relabel the bytecode, which can
be done in one pass as follows: We initialize an `Option{Int16,missing}` Vector the
size of the program, and a running count during the pass of how many bytes we've
added or removed, such that after a full pass, that Vector tells us: how much each
still-present instruction has moved, and whether a given offset still points at a
valid location.  There are passes where it's valid for jumps to point at a
now-missing location, but we always want to know that.  Because the count Vector and
the operation on it are both dense, we can reuse it for as many passes as we'd like.

Easy test is to generate a random number and take a program we have nice tests for
(such as `re`, soon), scatter a bunch of OpNoOps in it, correct, remove a bunch,
correct, and so on, testing each time.

### Serializing

Compiling is expensive, potentially very expensive once we start doing cool stuff.
And we make no use of the Pattern at all, except the top one as a container for
`aux`, after we create it. So I want to add a serialize-to-string function which is
as fast to load as computerly possible, some ideas: Capital letters are enums (Opcode
and CapKind), lowercase letters are short labels, - means what it always does, `n`
comes before `l`, jumps further than +-26 are hex as `0ff`, always lowercase because
we expect an opcode next, always at least two, if an n is encoded as hex, the label
is always encoded as hex.  I believe that's unambiguous and forward-only, and only
leaves out sets, which we already know how to serialize with show in a basically
optimal way, although we'll  make some minor changes in the interest of forward-only
unambigious optimality: starts with `{`, characters are in order and concatenated,
ranges start with `|` and cover the next two characters.  That leaves finality, which
comes before the `vec` and is `!` for false and `+` for true. The program section
ends with `.`, followed by a Julia serialization of the Dict.  We'll need to figure
out how to handle functions, the answer is **not** using eval on live Julia code, in
the Dict we encode them as `missing` and there's some technique to reload them at runtime.

## Notes on OG Lpeg

The OG code contains the basic algorithms we need, but they're expressed in a way which makes a close translation useless. For one thing they heavily manipulate the Lua VM, and for another, it's written in C, with all that implies.

The flow in the OG begins at the bottom of `lpltree.c`, where the Lua interface is created and registered, and works its way backward from the perspective I need to take to translate it.

The interface is various ways of creating patterns, the details of which are largely useless for us, since it's all about pulling the relevant information out of Lua into C.  This involves creating two structs, `Pattern`s and `TTree`s, where a Pattern is a container for both a Tree and its bytecode.  Trees are tagged with an enum saying what variety of tree we're dealing with, a second enum indicating the variety of capture (if it is one), either zero, one, or two children, and sometimes a counter.

Trees are built into more complex patterns through combinator rules, which become parent to the existing patterns, and as grammars, where they eventually get checked and resolved in various ways.

`lp_match` causes the tree to be compiled, and these instructions are passed to the VM for match proper, which runs the bytecode.

## Strategy

The distinction between Pattern and TTree isn't something we really need, I don't
think.  The distinction is basically between the encapsulation of Lua-side userdata,
code, and a TTree, where the latter is used to do manipulation of the pattern stuff
without affecting the Lua VM.  We can just have Patterns as containers that also do
the Tree-like things.

## Implementation Notes and Details

Current work is on captures, and the early foray has convinced me that the Julian
solution will differ considerably both from the Lua (in Julia, not _everything_ is a
table/Dict) and from how the regex package implements AbstractMatch. So this is notes on how I want captures to work, and we'll work back from there.

Syntax: mostly, I like the "your tuple is a capture" syntax, and will add "your vector is a group of captures" to that.

```julia
( :a  ←  P"123" * ("abc",) | [("qwerty", :qwerty) | :b ],
  :b  ←  (("qwertz", :qwertz) | ("azerty", :azerty))^1 )
```

## Back references: Mark and Check

This is the separate mechanism I want to add based on the code I hacked together for
bridge.  A Mark wraps the sequence in Choice/Commit, but this one is MarkCommit: we
pop the choice frame and combine it with the MarkCommit, and this goes on its own stack.
There's also a CheckCommit, every Mark/Check pair has its own name in the Pattern but we
convert these to a counter since the VM doesn't need them. The Check looks backward for
the first Mark, if it's within the first, say, eight frames (usually it's on top) we
remove it, if not, we slip in a hold frame, and one of the canonical mark/check actions
is performed, namely: are they the same substring, is one longer than the other, or
equal length without regard to contents.  There's also a runtime mark for taking an
Action on both captures, the result of which succeeds or fails the pattern.

I _could_ implement this as captures but there are good reasons not to, this decomplects
what is after all a pattern-matching operation from capturing, Mark/Check can cross rule
and capture boundaries freely, which is the important thing from my perspective.

## Dialects

Making progress on captures, want to get these thoughts out of my head to return to later.

JLPeg will offer dialects for strings which compile to patterns, at least these:

- `re`:  Implementation of Lpeg `re` module

- `peg`: Implementation of Sam Atman style PEG grammars

- `dialect`: For specifying dialects. I simply suspect this will be useful.

- `regex`: I don't see any reason we can't interpret PCRE regex format on the VM.

- `canonical`  A string form any dialect may be transformed to, and any
               Pattern printed as. Needs to be feature complete, rather than
               pleasant to look at or write, but must be legible. This is
               necessary for, among other things:

### Grammar Transforming Dialects

I dunno how this works actually, but the example I have in mind transforms grammars
into highlighters, so it's a DSL to specify StyledStrings annotations to perform on a
recognized grammar.

### More Dialect Notes

So there's [ReplMaker](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/ReplMaker) for
constructing custom repl modes, which we can use for dialect and grammar builders

### Expr parser

This is something I wanted to do in Lua, Julia having a canonical Expr format makes
the idea bearable, but this is a separate VM, or program really, which reparses
changes to a parser Expr to see when they remain valid to the specified Grammar.
Crucial for getting rid of Treesitter.
